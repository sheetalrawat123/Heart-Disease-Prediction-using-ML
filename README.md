# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
Heart is an important organ of the human body. It pumps blood to every part of our body. If it fails to function properly then, the brain and other organs will stop working and in few minutes the person will die.

We are well aware of the fact that a large number of people in the world die due to heart disease. This is because the disease is not identified and diagnosed at earlier stage. 

This project aims at predicting the presence of heart disease on the basis of 13 attributes using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Accuracy of prediction is analyzed using various algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector.

Dataset used has been downloaded from Kaggle and I have taken help from towardsdatascience to do this project.
